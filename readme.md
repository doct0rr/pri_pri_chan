Link to the chatBot
Facebook's new messenger api verification takes 48 hours to verify and enble my bot to see messages currently the api only shows the user the message is coming from and not the actual message so i cannot code a proper reply system.

the Local server based code is in the localS branch.
the bot with heroku is at the master branch. 
and the bot with a reply system is in the second last commit of the master branch.
